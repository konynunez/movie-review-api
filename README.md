# Movie Review App

This is a **Movie Review API** built using **Express**, **TypeScript**, and the **Supabase REST API**. The API allows users to manage movies, add reviews for movies, and rate the reviews. It demonstrates full CRUD operations and uses Supabase for database storage and relationship management between movies, reviews, and ratings.

## Features

- **Movies**: Add, view, and delete movies.
- **Reviews**: Add and view reviews for specific movies.
- **Review Ratings**: Rate reviews on a scale of 1 to 5.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Express with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL via Supabase REST API)
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios (for interacting with Supabase REST API)
- **Environment Management**: dotenv

## Database Schema

### Tables

1. **Movie**: Stores information about movies (id, title, release year).
2. **Review**: Stores user reviews for movies, with a foreign key to the Movie table.
3. **ReviewRating**: Stores ratings for reviews, with a foreign key to the Review table.

### SQL Schema

```sql
create table Movie (
  id bigint primary key generated always as identity,
  title text not null,
  release_year int not null
);

create table Review (
  id bigint primary key generated always as identity,
  MovieID bigint,
  content text not null,
  timestamp timestamp with time zone,
  foreign key (MovieID) references Movie (id) on delete cascade
);

create table ReviewRating (
  id bigint primary key generated always as identity,
  ReviewID bigint,
  rating int check (rating >= 1 and rating <= 5),
  foreign key (ReviewID) references Review (id) on delete cascade
);
```

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- A **Supabase account** and project set up (with your Supabase API keys)
- A **Supabase database** with the schema defined above

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/movie-review-app.git
   cd movie-review-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following content:

   ```bash
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-api-key
   PORT=4000
   ```

4. Create a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of the project:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ES2020",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "strict": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true,
       "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
       "outDir": "./dist"
     },
     "include": ["api/**/*"]
   }
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Supabase Setup

1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project.
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard.
3. Run the schema SQL commands provided above to create the tables (`Movie`, `Review`, `ReviewRating`).
4. Copy your **Supabase URL** and **API Key** from the Supabase project settings and add them to your `.env` file.

### API Example Usage

- **Adding a Movie**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/movies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Inception", "release_year": 2010}'
  ```

- **Adding a Review for a Movie**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/movies/1/reviews \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Amazing movie!"}'
  ```

- **Rating a Review**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/reviews/1/rate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rating": 5}'
  ```

## Error Handling

- Handles errors such as missing resources or invalid input with proper HTTP status codes (e.g., `404` for not found, `400` for bad requests).
- Provides meaningful error messages for easier debugging.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication to the API using JWT.
- Implement pagination for large movie and review lists.
- Add caching for popular movie and review requests.

This should now match the structure you're planning to use, with the **`api`** folder containing the routes and no **`src`** folder. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
